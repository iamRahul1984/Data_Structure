Every object in Python keeps a count of how many references point to it. When this reference count becomes zero, the object is automatically removed from memory. Python also detects and removes unused or unreachable objects, including those involved in circular references. This process helps free unused memory, prevents memory leaks, and ensures efficient use of memory without programmer intervention."
